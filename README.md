A template Rust project with fully functional and no-frills Nix support, as well as builtin VSCode configuration to get IDE experience without any manual setup (just [install direnv](https://nixos.asia/en/direnv), open in VSCode and accept the suggestions). It uses [crane](https://crane.dev/), via [rust-flake](https://github.com/juspay/rust-flake).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking for the original template based on [this blog post](https://srid.ca/rust-nix)'s use of `crate2nix`, browse from [this tag](https://github.com/srid/rust-nix-template/tree/crate2nix). The evolution of this template can be gleaned from [releases](https://github.com/srid/rust-nix-template/releases).

## Adapting this template

- Run `nix develop` to have a working shell ready before name change.
- Change `name` in Cargo.toml.
- Run `cargo generate-lockfile` in the nix shell
- There are two CI workflows, and one of them uses Nix which is slower (unless you configure a cache) than the other that is based on rustup. Pick one or the other depending on your trade-offs.

## Development (Flakes)

This repo uses [Flakes](https://nixos.asia/en/flakes) from the get-go.

```bash
# Dev shell
nix develop

# or run via cargo
nix develop -c cargo run

# build
nix build
```

We also provide a [`justfile`](https://just.systems/) for Makefile'esque commands.
